          <p><span>ABOUT ME</span></p><br>
          <p>Simply put, I am a lover of puzzles and outdoors. Most of my major
            life choices are centered around these things -- guiding me in my career aspirations,
            where I live, how I travel, and which hobbies I participate in.  Below is 
            an outline of my journey, leading to where I am today!
          </p><br><br>
          <p><span class="years">1985-2003 >></span>  I grew up in Saint Charles, IL and enjoyed hobbies like
            cross-country skiing and horse-back riding.  My favorite subject in High School
            was math (surprise, surprise!)
          </p><br>
          <p><span class="years">2003-2010 >></span>  I went to Iowa State University and studied Mathematics. After undergrad,
            I stayed at Iowa State for my Masters in Applied Mathematics.  I was also fortunate
            to work for the Iowa State Outdoor Recreated Program during this time and led
            outdoors trips to various destinations (including rock-climbing in Death Valley, Canyoneering in Zion, 
            and Rafting the Green River).
          </p><br>
          <p><span class="years">2010-2013 >></span>  After grad school, I moved to Denver, CO.  I had known for a long
            time that I wanted to live near the mountains and I was so excited to finally 
            take this step. I also started a career teaching High School and Community College 
            mathematics.  There are many things that I love and miss about teaching, 
            however I decided I wanted to pursue a career which presents more opportunity 
            for new, ever-changing challenges.
          </p><br>
          <p><span class="years">2013-2017 >></span>  I began a new career as a data analyst and trully enjoyed learning
            a variety of new skills.  I found that I most enjoyed any project that allowed me to
            write any sort of code, which consisted mostly of SQL and VBA for the analyst role.  
            At the end of 2017, I began to consider another career shift to software development 
            so that I could work in a world centered around coding.  Over these years, I also 
            began to do more solo adventuresm exploring longer and deeper in the mountains.  
          </p><br>
          <p><span class="years">2018-current >></span>  Over the course of 2018, I began looking into different areas
            of software development that I might be most interested in.  I started self-teaching python,
            and really enjoyed the learning and problem-solving.  By the end of the year, I decided to speed up my
            entry to a software development career and signed up for the Tech Academy Bootcamp,
            which I am currently enrolled in.
