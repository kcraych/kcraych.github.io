  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  <p>
    Simply put, I am a lover of puzzles and outdoors. Most of my major
    life choices are centered around these things -- guiding me in my career aspirations,
    where I live, how I travel, and which hobbies I participate in. See below for more 
    about what drives me!

        My parents always encouraged me to always ask "why" and "how" things work, which inherently 
        guided me into a professional life centered around logic and problem solving.  For college, 
        I went to Iowa State University and studied Mathematics and loved it so much that I stuck around
        to get my masters in math.  You'll often find me throwing little logic riddles out to friends, 
        spending a snowy Sunday working on a puzzle, or enjoying an article on prime numbers.

        This goes hand in hand with the constant curiosity of why and how things work.  After all,
        the best way to learn how something works is to build it!  Some of my more notable projects include
        building a bike, putting together a computer, and building my dining room table.  My most recent project 
        was building an easily removable sleeping platform in the back of my Subaru for Colorado weekend adventures.

        I began a new career as a data analyst and trully enjoyed learning
        a variety of new skills.  I found that I most enjoyed any project that allowed me to
        write any sort of code, which consisted mostly of SQL and VBA for the analyst role.  
        At the end of 2017, I began to consider a career shift to software development 
        so that I could work in a world centered around coding.  Over these years, I also 
        began to do more solo adventuresm exploring longer and deeper in the mountains.
