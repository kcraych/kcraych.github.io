  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  <p>
    Simply put, I am a lover of puzzles and outdoors. Most of my major
    life choices are centered around these things -- guiding me in my career aspirations,
    where I live, how I travel, and which hobbies I participate in.  Below is 
    an outline of my journey, leading to where I am today!

      I went to Iowa State University and studied Mathematics. After undergrad,
      I stayed at Iowa State for my Masters in Applied Mathematics.  I was also fortunate
      to work for the Iowa State Outdoor Recreated Program during this time and led
      outdoors trips to various destinations (including rock-climbing in Death Valley, Canyoneering in Zion, 
      and Rafting the Green River).

      After grad school, I moved to Denver, CO.  I had known for a long
      time that I wanted to live near the mountains and I was so excited to finally 
      take this step. I also started a career teaching High School and Community College 
      mathematics.  There are many things that I love and miss about teaching, 
      however I decided I wanted to pursue a career which presents more opportunity 
      for new, ever-changing challenges.

    <h3 class="card-header bg-dk-gray txt-white">2013-2017</h3>
    <p class="card-content">
      I began a new career as a data analyst and trully enjoyed learning
      a variety of new skills.  I found that I most enjoyed any project that allowed me to
      write any sort of code, which consisted mostly of SQL and VBA for the analyst role.  
      At the end of 2017, I began to consider a career shift to software development 
      so that I could work in a world centered around coding.  Over these years, I also 
      began to do more solo adventuresm exploring longer and deeper in the mountains.

    <h3 class="card-header bg-dk-gray txt-white">2018-current</h3>
    <p class="card-content">
      Over the course of 2018, I began looking into different areas
      of software development that I might be most interested in.  I started self-teaching python,
      and really enjoyed the learning and problem-solving.  By the end of the year, I decided to speed up my
      entry to a software development career and signed up for the Tech Academy Bootcamp,
      which I am currently enrolled in.
